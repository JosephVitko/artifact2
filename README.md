# ENGL 1102 Artifact 2
This is the frontend for our Artifact 2 project for ENGL 1102. It was made in React and makes API calls to the backend of my personal website, made with Flask. The API returns words, definitions, and images/videos in JSON format. The frontend parses this data and displays it in Bootstrap cards.

Todo:

Add ability to add/update words directly on the website for admins
Auto-sorting of words alphabetically
